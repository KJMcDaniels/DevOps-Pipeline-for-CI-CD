[**The Knowledge House**](https://www.linkedin.com/school/theknowledgehouse/) Cybersecurity Fellowship's Phase 3 marks a vital stage in the journey of innovation and collaboration. It is a stage where the convergence of diverse talents and minds transcends the ordinary, fostering an environment where collective creativity thrives. This phase represents not merely a privilege but a cornerstone that solidifies the foundation of teamwork, empowering fellows to harness the power of unity in crafting impactful solutions. It stands as a testament to the belief that when a group of dedicated individuals unite, the potential for transformative change becomes limitless. The Knowledge House exemplifies an unwavering commitment to guiding fellows through a transformative process, equipping them with the skills and mindset necessary to thrive in the tech industry and beyond.

For this capstone project, the team  goal is to implement a chatbot application on AWS in a secure and automated manner by leveraging a DevOps approach. Specifically, we aim to design and configure a secure automated CI/CD pipeline that integrates security measures throughout the entire application lifecycle. This will enable us to deliver a secure and reliable chatbot application faster by automating the integration of security practices into the development of the chatbot.

The key objective is to successfully implement a chatbot development workflow that incorporates secure automated processes, which will be achieved through the implementation of a secure automated CI/CD pipeline.
